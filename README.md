## Description

LL Hedge EA MT5 is a trading expert advisor for MetaTrader 5 platform. It is designed to implement a hedge strategy based on MA cross indicator. The EA places buy market orders and sell pending stop orders according to the signals generated by the MA cross indicator.

### Features
- Lot multiplier for the sell pending stop order
- Maximum allowed risk per trade
- Stop loss level for each position
- Take profit level for each position

## Usage

1. Set the desired values for the input parameters:
   - `lotMultiplier`: Lot multiplier for the sell pending stop order
   - `maxRisk`: Maximum allowed risk per trade
   - `stopLoss`: Stop loss level for each position
   - `takeProfit`: Take profit level for each position
   
2. Run the LL Hedge EA MT5 on your MetaTrader 5 platform.

## How it Works

The LL Hedge EA MT5 uses the MA cross indicator to generate buy signals. When a buy signal is detected, the EA places a buy market order and a sell pending stop order. The lot size for the orders is calculated based on the account balance and the maximum allowed risk per trade.

### Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. You can add any necessary initialization code in this function.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called during the deinitialization of the expert advisor. You can add any necessary deinitialization code in this function.

### Tick Function

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick of the market. In this function, the MA cross indicator is implemented to generate buy signals. If a buy signal is detected, the EA places a buy market order and a sell pending stop order. Position management and risk management can also be implemented in this function.

### Calculate Lot Size

The `CalculateLotSize` function calculates the lot size based on the account balance and the maximum allowed risk per trade. The lot size is normalized to two decimal places.

### Performance Monitoring

The `MonitorPerformance` function can be used to implement performance monitoring code.

### Strategy Analysis

The `AnalyzeStrategy` function can be used to analyze the strategy performance by implementing backtesting and optimization code.
